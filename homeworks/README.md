> Use the matched NSC/HSC and SDSS data (QSO sample) to generate classifications that will separate stars and QSOs based on color (note you might have to change the redshift range of the QSO sample dependent on the colors you have access to in order to separate the different populations). Divide your sample into a test and training set and generate an ROC curve for each classification technique.

  > Group 1:
  
  > - LDA
  > - GMM 
  > - SVM 

> Group 2:
> - Naive Bayes
> - KNN
> - Decision Trees/Random Forest
 
>In each case, if you run into a deprecation warning in any astroML package (e.g. GMM), update the package and file a pull request against astroML
